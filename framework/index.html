                Bears are mammals that belong to the family Ursidae. They can be as
                small as four feet long and about 60 pounds (the sun bear) to as big as
                eight feet long and more than a thousand pounds (the polar bear).

              They have nonretractable claws, short tails, and excellent sense of
              smell. They're typically solitary, except for mothers with cubs.
